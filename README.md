# RR-Cord
A reaction role discord bot that gives out roles from ticking reactions.\
The bot has plenty of modes to come up with:

* **Once** - A user can only grab one role per rr set.
* **Many** - A user can grab one or more role(s) per rr set.
* **Verify** - A bit similar to `Once` but it removes their reaction.
